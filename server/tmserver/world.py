        receive events that object emits.
        We want a set that includes:
        - the sender (you can hear yourself)
        - objects that contain that player object
        - objects contained by player object
        - objects contained by objects that contain the player object

        these four categories can, for the most part, correspond to:
        - a player of the game
        - the room a player is in
        - the player's inventory
        - objects in the same room as the player

        thought experiment: the bag

        my player object has been put inside a bag. The bag _contains_ my
        player object, and is in a way my "room." it's my conceit that
        whatever thing contains that bag should not receive the events my
        player object generates.

        this is easier to implement and also means you can "muffle" an object
        by stuffing it into a box.
